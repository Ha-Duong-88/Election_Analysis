# Election-Audit Summary: In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

This Python elections audit analysis script can be leveraged for any elections with some minor modifcations. To enable re-use of the script, the following modifications to this script are proposed:

    1) Remove the print statements and only print to a text file to optimize the code run-time performance; 
    2)
